# Blackjack of Truth and Josstice!
This is both my first Python project, and my first coding project ever!  
It is also the second assessment in my first term of CoderAcademy!  
Welcome fellow alumni and fellow cohort members!

## Gameplay and Features
Player and table data is either initialised through a new game, or loaded from JSON files to continue progress. There are multiple control flows and loops used to not only parse and create data, but to enable the player to play a realistic blackjack simulator! 
Specific features and functions:
- Save file creation: Creates new player data and tables with base stats in JSON format.
- Play poker: Loads in data from previous saved files, allows player to play at four different tables with different rulesets and bet limits. Individual tables have specific amounts of chips to be won.
- Poker hands using customised asciicard function: Allows player cards to be displayed in line and calculated using CSV files.
- "AI" and results: Many control flows for bet amounts, a rudimentary AI for the dealer, finally ammendments made to stat files to change player and table stats.
